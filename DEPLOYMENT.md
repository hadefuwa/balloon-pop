# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Method 1: Manual Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Visit your repository: https://github.com/hadefuwa/balloon-pop
2. Click on the **Settings** tab at the top

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
2. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Choose **"main"** branch from the dropdown
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will show "Your site is being built"
- Wait 1-2 minutes for the first deployment
- You'll see a green checkmark when ready

### Step 4: Access Your Game
- Your game will be available at: **https://hadefuwa.github.io/balloon-pop/**
- The URL will be displayed in the Pages section

## Method 2: Using GitHub Actions (Automatic)

I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy your game whenever you push changes to the main branch.

### To enable this:
1. The workflow file is already in your repository (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
2. Push the workflow to trigger automatic deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
   git push
   ```

### Benefits of GitHub Actions:
- âœ… Automatic deployment on every push
- âœ… No manual setup required
- âœ… Faster deployment times
- âœ… Better error handling

## ðŸŽ® Test Your Deployed Game

Once deployed, test these features:
- âœ… Start game button works
- âœ… Balloons spawn and float up
- âœ… Clicking balloons pops them and adds points
- âœ… Difficulty increases over time
- âœ… Pause/resume functionality
- âœ… Sound effects (if enabled)
- âœ… Mobile responsiveness

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If the game doesn't load:
1. Check that all files are in the repository
2. Ensure the repository is public
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build
4. Check the Actions tab for any deployment errors

### If you see a 404 error:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled
2. Check that the main branch is selected as source
3. Wait for the deployment to complete

### If the game loads but doesn't work:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure all files are properly linked

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing

Your game is fully responsive! Test it on:
- âœ… Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- âœ… Tablet browsers

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Share your game URL with friends
2. Consider adding a custom domain
3. Monitor the Actions tab for deployment status
4. Make updates and push to see automatic deployment
